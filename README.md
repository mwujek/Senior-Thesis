## now

- debug the vertice problem
- make a button to restart sketch...this will restart the values to be desaturated regardless of the ipad slider positions
- make range rather than 3 states...might be too difficult with 4 seperate variables (-4 to 4)
- Think about using absolute value for the values above^^^


- ### Installation
- write copy for the information table
- make wireframe illustrations
- business cards

### tests 

- split screen into two sections! Use only what is necessary: 1 circle class generated from the top.
- crop video (to crop out the dark sides)
