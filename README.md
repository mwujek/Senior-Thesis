## now

- debug the vertice problem
- make a button to restart sketch...this will restart the values to be desaturated regardless of the ipad slider positions
- make range rather than 3 states...might be too difficult with 4 seperate variables (-4 to 4)
- Think about using absolute value for the values above^^^


- ### Installation
- write copy for the information table
- business cards

### soon 

- split screen into two sections! (left is possible. How do you do two?? Another object for openCV?)
