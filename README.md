## now

- split screen into two sections! (left is possible. How do you do two?? Another object for openCV?)
- make if/else statements for each of the 16 types (16 Left + 16 Right = 32 total)
- make this code on a new tab
- use simple boolean to trigger the attractor position. THEN...
- Add two toggle states...see table for rules (change attractors to left or right)

### soon 

- write copy for the information table
- business card (edge painted DIY)
- table design
=======
## (1) Days to milestone

- reconfigure thesis hypothesis (instead of spectrum, four states?) You could change the color as a spectrum, but change the attractors in 4-6 states rather than a range.
